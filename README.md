# EDATITANIC
Exploratory data analysis on titanic data set
this filecontains the python code on the jupyter notebooks in order to perform EDA on titanic dataset.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper class.
The goal of this program is to analyse the given data and provide a graph between the people who survived and those who died based on various factors such as age, sex, etc.
